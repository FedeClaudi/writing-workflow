  abstract = "To analyse neuron data at scale, neuroscientists expend
              substantial effort reading documentation, installing dependencies
              and moving between analysis and visualisation environments. To
              facilitate this, we have developed a suite of interoperable
              open-source R packages called the natverse. The natverse allows
              users to read local and remote data, perform popular analyses
              including visualisation and clustering and graph-theoretic
              analysis of neuronal branching. Unlike most tools, the natverse
              enables comparison across many neurons of morphology and
              connectivity after imaging or co-registration within a common
              template space. The natverse also enables transformations between
              different template spaces and imaging modalities. We demonstrate
              tools that integrate the vast majority of Drosophila
              neuroanatomical light microscopy and electron microscopy
              connectomic datasets. The natverse is an easy-to-use environment
              for neuroscientists to solve complex, large-scale analysis
              challenges as well as an open platform to create new code and
              packages to share with the community.",

              However, mapping these neurons manually is prone to bias and is

              fluorescent proteins expressed via retrograde trans-synaptic

  abstract  = "Vision, choice, action and behavioural engagement arise from
               neuronal activity that may be distributed across brain regions.
               Here we delineate the spatial distribution of neurons underlying
               these processes. We used Neuropixels probes1,2 to record from
               approximately 30,000 neurons in 42 brain regions of mice
               performing a visual discrimination task3. Neurons in nearly all
               regions responded non-specifically when the mouse initiated an
               action. By contrast, neurons encoding visual stimuli and
               upcoming choices occupied restricted regions in the neocortex,
               basal ganglia and midbrain. Choice signals were rare and emerged
               with indistinguishable timing across regions. Midbrain neurons
               were activated before contralateral choices and were suppressed
               before ipsilateral choices, whereas forebrain neurons could
               prefer either side. Brain-wide pre-stimulus activity predicted
               engagement in individual trials and in the overall task, with
               enhanced subcortical but suppressed neocortical activity during
               engagement. These results reveal organizing principles for the
               distribution of neurons encoding behaviourally relevant
               variables across the mouse brain.",
